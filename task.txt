In this game, we will create 3 levels: easy, medium, and hard. At the start of the game, the shapes are hidden. The player clicks on the tiles to uncover the tile and when two similar tiles are uncovered the score increases. To complete the game the user has to uncover all the pairs of shapes. After completion of the game, the number of moves required to complete the game is also displayed on the screen.

Python Memory Puzzle Game Project
The main objective of the project is to develop a memory puzzle game that has three different levels. Installation of tkinter is a must to start developing the project.

Project Prerequisites
Basic concepts of Python and TKinter are required to get ahead with the project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 1.

Start creating the base of the game

Hint.
a. random: random helps in generating random numbers.
b. Tk(): It provides a library of basic elements of gui widgets.
c. title(): It helps in setting the title of the screen.
d. ttk.Notebook(): This widget manages the collection of windows and displays one window at a time.
e. ttk.Frame(): It is basically a rectangular container for other widgets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Task 2.
Various functions required for creating easy level

Create easy level

Hint.
a. draw(): This function helps in drawing different figures that are hidden under tiles.
b. create_rectangle(): It helps in drawing a rectangle on the screen.
c. create_polygon():It helps in drawing a polygon on the screen.
d. create_oval():It helps in drawing an oval on the screen.
e. quizboard: It helps in developing the board for the easy level which is a 4×4 box.
f. call(): This function is called when the player clicks on the tile. This function displays the figures hidden in the tile if the two figures are the same and hides the figure if the other figure that is selected is not the same.
g. Canvas: It adds structured graphics in the python applications.
h. List: It is used to store a list of numbers, string, characters etc.
i. shuffle(): It takes a list and then reorganizes the elements in the list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 3.

creating medium level

Hint.

a. draw1(): This function helps in drawing different figures that are hidden under tiles.
b. quizboard2(): It helps in developing the board for the medium level which is a 6×6 box.
c. Create_text: It can be applied to a canvas object which helps in writing text on it.
d. call2():This function is called when the player clicks on the tile. This function displays the figures hidden in the tile if the two figures are the same and hides the figure if the other figure that is selected is not the same.
e. IntVar: It returns the value of a variable as an integer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 4.

creating hard level

Hint.

a. draw2(): This function helps in drawing different figures that are hidden under tiles.
b. quizboard3(): It helps in developing the board for the medium level which is a 8×8 box.
c. call3():This function is called when the player clicks on the tile. This function displays the figures hidden in the tile if the two figures are the same and hides the figure if the other figure that is selected is not the same.
d. shuffle(): It takes a list and then reorganizes the elements in the list.
